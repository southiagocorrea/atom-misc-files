Makes sense and I did finally get it to work. I couldn't seem to get the homebrew option to install successfully, but the Composer version worked fine.

I'm adding my steps here so it's documented for anyone else who might have this problem.

1. Install Composer (https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
Run:
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

2. Install PHP-CS-Fixer (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)
Run:
$ curl http://get.sensiolabs.org/php-cs-fixer.phar -o php-cs-fixer
$ sudo chmod a+x php-cs-fixer
$ sudo mv php-cs-fixer /usr/local/bin/php-cs-fixer

That got everything working for me.
